/**
 *
 * <p>This is a layout that enables anchoring of contained elements relative to the container's dimensions.  If
 * the container is resized, all anchored items are automatically rerendered according to their anchor rules.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>AnchorLayout does not have any direct config options (other than inherited ones).  However, the container
 * using the AnchorLayout can supply an anchoring-specific config property of <b>anchorSize</b>.  By default,
 * AnchorLayout will calculate anchor measurements based on the size of the container itself.  However, if
 * anchorSize is specifed, the layout will use it as a virtual container for the purposes of calculating anchor
 * measurements based on it instead, allowing the container to be sized independently of the anchoring logic if necessary.</p>
 *
 * <p>The items added to an AnchorLayout can also supply an anchoring-specific config property of <b>anchor</b> which
 * is a string containing two values: the horizontal anchor value and the vertical anchor value (for example, '100% 50%').
 * This value is what tells the layout how the item should be anchored to the container.  The following types of
 * anchor values are supported:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Percentage</b>: Any value between 1 and 100, expressed as a percentage.  The first anchor is the percentage
 * width that the item should take up within the container, and the second is the percentage height.  Example: '100% 50%'
 * would render an item the complete width of the container and 1/2 its height.  If only one anchor value is supplied
 * it is assumed to be the width value and the height will default to auto.</li>
 * <li><b>Offsets</b>: Any positive or negative integer value.  The first anchor is the offset from the right edge of
 * the container, and the second is the offset from the bottom edge.  Example: '-50 -100' would render an item the
 * complete width of the container minus 50 pixels and the complete height minus 100 pixels.  If only one anchor value
 * is supplied it is assumed to be the right offset value and the bottom offset will default to 0.</li>
 * <li><b>Sides</b>: Valid values are 'right' (or 'r') and 'bottom' (or 'b').  Either the container must have a fixed
 * size or an anchorSize config value defined at render time in order for these to have any effect.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Anchor values can also be mixed as needed.  For example, '-50 75%' would render the width offset from the
 * container right edge by 50 pixels and 75% of the container's height.</p>
