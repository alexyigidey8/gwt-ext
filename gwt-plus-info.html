    <h1>Information on GWT-Plus</h1>
    <p/>Here are the high level features of the Store / GWT-RPC integration :
    <ul>
        <li>Integrates the data returned by a GWT-RPC service call into a GWT-Ext Store</li>
        <li>Also supports loading a List of local beans into a GWT-Ext Store</li>
        <li>Transparent and seamless mapping of Store and Record API's with the underlying user JavaBean object</li>
        <li>Support for read and write of nested JavaBean properties (unlimited nesting)</li>
        <li>Store#getModifiedRecords() allows you to get a list of modified JavaBean objects which can then be sent to
            the server
        </li>
        <li>Fine grain control of which properties are exposed to the Record API as fields</li>
        <li>Integration of GWT-RPC exception with associated Store exceptions</li>
        <li>Propagation of sort / page / filter and user defined parameters to user's RPC call in a flexible way without
            enforcing a specific API on the RPC call
        </li>
    </ul>

    With this functionality you'll be able to specify your GWT-RPC service API that returns a list of domain beans /
    DTO's and load it into a
    Store which can be used to display data in a Grid, ComboBox or a Form. If you're using an EditableGrid, any
    modifications to the data will be
    reflected in your underlying data beans. You can retrieve the modified beans by calling Store#getModifiedRecords()
    and then make a GWT-RPC
    call to persist the changes. Sorting / Paging and Filtering of Grid data is also greatly simplified as the table
    sort / page / filter
    parameters are made accessible to your service and you can have your backend return data based on these parameters /
    criteria.
    <p/>
    The GWT-Plus package presently ships with a few samples :
    <ul>
        <li>
            Demo of an EditableGrid which gets data using GWT-RPC and also demonstrates passing back the modified beans
            to
            the server. Additionally the table paging parameters (page size , page num) and sorting parameters from the
            Grid are made available to the
            RPC call and passed to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Same as above except that the data is laoded using a List of local data beans.
        </li>
        <li>
            An example of ComboBox - Form - Grid example where all three widgets are bound to the same underlying data
            which is retreived using a GWT-RPC call. The ComboBox data is pageable, and a selection
            dispalys to corresponding Record in the Form and Grid. Selecting a row in the Grid results in the selected
            Record being dispalyed in the Form. Editing the Record in the Form
            reflects in the Grid and conversely editing a cell in the Grid reflects in the Form.
        </li>

        <li>
            Same as above except that the data is loaded using a List of local data beans.
        </li>
    </ul>

    The examples will grow over time to include master - detail tables, related combos etc. and I will post
    updates.
