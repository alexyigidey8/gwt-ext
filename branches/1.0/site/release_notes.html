      <h2>Release Notes for 0.9</h2>
      <p>
      This is the first release of GWT-Ext. While a large percentage of the Ext API's are covered, currently there's not much in the form
      of user documentation, Javadocs and test cases. The idea is to put out a version of GWT-Ext for users
      to take a look at and provide feedback and report bugs. A large percentage of the Ext API's like data, grid, forms, layoutds, menus have
      very complete coverage in GWT-Ext. The most notable area that is missing is the Ext Drag and Drop (dd package) API's. 
      </p>
      Please join the GWT-Ext <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-ext">Developer Forum</a> to post questions and provide feedback.
